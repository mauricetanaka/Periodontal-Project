                As our patient and our direct client, you are responsible for payment of all procedures offered. We do not
                have a contract with a health insurance company or any other third party. However, you will receive a
                comprehensive billing statement that you can submit to your medical aid for direct reimbursement.<br />Our
                treatment plans are easy to understand and designed to be transparent and accepted by medical aids in South
                Africa. We recommend that you submit your estimate to your medical aid provider so that you can get a feel for
                how much you will be reimbursed after your treatment.<br />For your convenience, we accept cash, credit and
                debit cards (Visa, Master Card). Electronic payments can be made at the practice or from home before treatment
                begins.<br />It is important that you understand and agree to both the treatment plan and the estimated
                treatment costs; you have the right to accept or decline the treatment plan we recommend. If you reject or
                delay the recommended treatment, you do so at your own risk. You will be asked to sign consent to our
                treatment plan and cost estimate prior to any procedure. If clinical conditions require a change in treatment,
                you will be advised of the details and cost before we proceed.<br />For implant procedures, the cost of the
                , its components and any biomaterials must be paid and cleared at least three working days before the
                procedure so that the required parts can be delivered. Otherwise the operation may be cancelled.<br />The cost
                estimates are usually valid for 3 months. Your medical aid is a contract between you and the health insurance
                company and NOT between the doctor and the health insurance company. All medical aid companies have different
                conditions, limits and benefit levels. We do not take responsibility for your medical aid cover and you are
                responsible for paying all bills.<br />Our tariffs are classified as “private tariffs&#34; and may be slightly
                higher than health insurance tariffs.
